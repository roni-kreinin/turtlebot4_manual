# Create® 3

On the TurtleBot 4, the connection of the User Interface board with the Create® 3 robot is only through the VBAT connector J7, which uses JST XH-style connector. The connector has been marked with Positive and Negative signs on the board (Positive being pin 1). The VBAT line is fused with a PTC fuse rated at 2A.
