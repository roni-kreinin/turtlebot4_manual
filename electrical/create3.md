# Create® 3

On the TurtleBot 4, the connection of the User Interface board with the Create® 3 robot is only through the VBAT connector J7, which uses <span style="color:blue">JST XH-style</span> connector. The connector has been marked with Positive and Negative signs on the board (Positive being pin 1). The VBAT line is fused with a PTC fuse rated at 2A.

The Create® 3 power adapter also supplies the Raspberry Pi 4 with power and communication through a <span style="color:red">USB 2.0 (Type C)</span> on both the TurtleBot 4 and TurtleBot 4 Lite. The USB interface can supply up to 3A at 5V.
