- **EStop**: Call the */e_stop* service and toggle EStop state.

The TurtleBot 4 also supports the following menu functions:

- **Scroll Up**: Scroll menu up.
- **Scroll Down**: Scroll menu down.
- **Back**: Exit message screen or return to first menu entry.
- **Select**: Select currently highlighted menu entry.
- **Help**: Print help statement.

#### Configuration

This node can be configured using a parameter *.yaml* file. The default robot parameters can be found [here](https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot4_robot/blob/galactic/turtlebot4_bringup/config/turtlebot4.yaml). 

Parameters:

- **wifi.interface**: The Wi-Fi interface being used by the computer. This is used to find the current IP address of the computer.
- **menu.entries**: Set menu entries to be displayed. Each entry must be one of the support [functions](#functions).
- **buttons**: Set the function of Create® 3 and HMI buttons.
- **controller**: Set the function of TurtleBot 4 Controller buttons.

#### Buttons

The `Buttons` class in `turtlebot4_node` provides functionality to all buttons on the robot. This includes the Create® 3 buttons, HMI buttons, and TurtleBot 4 Controller buttons.
The node receives button states from the */interface_buttons*, */hmi/buttons*, and */joy* topics.

Each button can be configured to have either a single function when pressed, or two functions by using a short or long press. This is done through [configuration](#configuration).

Supported buttons:

```yaml
buttons:
    create3_1:
    create3_power:
    create3_2:
    hmi_1:
    hmi_2:
    hmi_3:
    hmi_4:

controller:
    a:
    b:
    x:
    y:
    up:
    down:
    left:
    right:
    l1:
    l2:
    l3:
    r1:
    r2:
    r3:
    share:
    options:
    home:
```

##### Example

Lets say we want the TurtleBot 4 to have the following button functions:
- Make a short press of Create® 3 button 1 toggle EStop.
- Power off robot with 5 second press of Home on the TurtleBot 4 Controller.
- Short press of HMI button 1 performs Wall Follow Left, long press of 3 seconds performs Wall Follow Right.

Create a new yaml file:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/turtlebot4_ws
touch example.yaml
```

Use your favourite text editor and paste the following into `example.yaml`:
```yaml
turtlebot4_node:
  ros__parameters:
    buttons:  
      create3_1: ["EStop"]
      hmi_1: ["Wall Follow Left", "Wall Follow Right", "3000"]

    controller:
      home: ["Power", "5000"]
```

Launch the robot with your new configuration:

```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot4_bringup standard.launch.py param_file:=/home/ubuntu/turtlebot4_ws/example.yaml
```

The buttons should now behave as described in `example.yaml`.

#### LEDs

The `Leds` class in `turtlebot4_node` controls the states of the HMI LEDs on the TurtleBot 4. It is not used for the TurtleBot 4 Lite.

There are 5 status LEDs which are controlled by the node: `POWER`, `MOTOR`, `COMMS`, `WIFI`, and `BATTERY`. There are also 2 user LEDs: `USER_1` and `USER_2` which are controlled by the user via the */hmi/led* topic. The `BATTERY` and `USER_2` LEDs consist of a red and green LED which allows them to be turned on as either green, red, or yellow (red + green). The rest are green only.

Status LEDs:
- **POWER**: Always ON while `turtlebot4_node` is running.
- **MOTOR**: ON when wheels are enabled, OFF when wheels are disabled.
    - Wheel status is reported on the */wheel_status* topic.
- **COMMS**: ON when communication with Create® 3 is active. OFF otherwise.
    - Receiving data on the */battery_state* topic implies that communication is active.
- **WIFI**: ON when an IP address can be found for the Wi-Fi interface specified in the [configuration](#configuration).
- **BATTERY**: Colour and pattern will vary based on battery percentage.
    - Battery percentage is received on */battery_state* topic.

User LEDs:

The user LEDs can be set by publishing to the */hmi/led* topic with a [UserLed](https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot4/blob/galactic/turtlebot4_msgs/msg/UserLed.msg) message.

UserLed message:

- **led**: Which available LED to use.
    - `uint8 USER_LED_1 = 0`
    - `uint8 USER_LED_2 = 1`
- **color**: Which color to set the LED to.
    - `uint8 COLOR_OFF = 0`
    - `uint8 COLOR_GREEN = 1`
    - `uint8 COLOR_RED = 2`
    - `uint8 COLOR_YELLOW = 3`
- **blink_period**: Blink period in milliseconds.
    - `uint32 ms`
- **duty_cycle**: Percentage of blink period that the LED is ON.
    - `float64 (0.0 to 1.0)`

##### Examples

Set `USER_1` to solid green:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /hmi/led turtlebot4_msgs/msg/UserLed "led: 0
color: 1
blink_period: 1000
duty_cycle: 1.0" --once
```

<figure class="aligncenter">
    <img src="media/user_1_green.png" alt="User 1 Green" style="width: 35%"/>
    <figcaption>User 1: Solid Green</figcaption>
</figure>

Set `USER_1` OFF:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /hmi/led turtlebot4_msgs/msg/UserLed "led: 0
color: 0
blink_period: 1000
duty_cycle: 1.0" --once
```

<figure class="aligncenter">
    <img src="media/user_1_off.png" alt="User 1 Off" style="width: 35%"/>
    <figcaption>User 1: Off</figcaption>
</figure>

Blink `USER_2` red at 1hz with 50% duty cycle:

```bash
ros2 topic pub /hmi/led turtlebot4_msgs/msg/UserLed "led: 1
color: 2
blink_period: 1000
duty_cycle: 0.5" --once
```

<figure class="aligncenter">
    <img src="media/user_2_red_blink.gif" alt="User 2 Red Blink" style="width: 35%"/>
    <figcaption>User 2: Red, 1hz, 50%</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Display

The `Display` class in `turtlebot4_node` controls the HMI display of the TurtleBot 4. The physical display is a 128x64 OLED which is controlled over I2C with a SSD1306 driver.

The display has a header line which contains the IP address of the Wi-Fi interface specified in [configuration](#configuration), as well as the battery percentage received on the */battery_state* topic. The display also has 5 additional lines which are used for the menu by default. The menu entries are specified in [configuration](#configuration) and are a set of the available functions. The 5 menu lines can be overwritten by publishing to the */hmi/display/message* with a **String** message.

```note
The menu can have any number of entries. If there are more than 5 entries, the user will have to scroll down to see the entries that do not fit on the 5 menu lines.
```

##### Menu Control

The TurtleBot 4 display has a simple scrolling menu. There are 4 control functions for the menu: Scroll up, Scroll down, Select, and Back. 

* Scroll up and down allow the users to navigate through the menu entries and by default are mapped to user buttons 3 and 4 respectively. 
* The select function will call the currently selected menu entry. This can trigger an action such as docking, a service such as EStop, or display a message such as the Help message. This function is mapped to user button 1 by default.
* The back function allows the user to return back to the menu from a message screen. If the menu is already showing the menu entries, it will return to showing the first 5 menu entries and the first entry will be highlighted.

## TurtleBot 4 Robot

Source code is available [here](https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot4_robot).

```note
The `turtlebot4_robot` metapackage contains packages that are used by the physical TurtleBot 4 robot and are run on the Raspberry Pi.
```

### Installation

The `turtlebot4_robot` metapackage is pre-installed on the TurtleBot 4 Raspberry Pi image.

#### Debian installation

To manually install the debian metapackage, use apt:

TODO

#### Source installation

To manually install this metapackage from source, clone the git repository:

```bash
cd ~/turtlebot4_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot4_robot.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd ~/turtlebot4_ws
vcs import src < src/turtlebot4_robot/dependencies.repos
rosdep install --from-path src -yi
```

Build the packages:

```bash
source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```

### Base

The `turtlebot4_base` package contains the source code for the [rclcpp](https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp) node `turtlebot4_base_node` which runs on the physical robot. This node interfaces with the GPIO lines of the Raspberry Pi which allows it to read the state of the buttons, as well as write to the LEDs and display.

Publishers:
- **/hmi/buttons**: *turtlebot4_msgs/msg/UserButton*
    - description: Button states of the TurtleBot 4 HMI (TurtleBot 4 model only).

Subscribers:
- **/hmi/display**: *turtlebot4_msgs/msg/UserDisplay*
    - description: The current information that is to be displayed (TurtleBot 4 model only).
- **/hmi/led/_<led>**: *std_msgs/msg/Int32*
    - description: Hidden topics indicating the state of each LED.

#### GPIO Interface

The TurtleBot 4 uses *libgpiod* to interface with the GPIO lines of the Raspberry Pi. The `gpiochip0` device represents the 40-pin header of the Raspberry Pi and is used for reading and writing to these pins.

#### I2C Interface

The linux I2C drivers are used to read and write data on the I2C buses of the Raspberry Pi. The display's SSD1306 driver is connected to the `i2c-3` device by default, but other buses are available too.

#### SSD1306

The SSD1306 is a driver for OLED displays. It receives commands over a communication bus (I2C for the TurtleBot 4) and controls how the physical display behaves. The TurtleBot 4 uses a modified version of this [STM32 SSD1306 driver](https://github.com/afiskon/stm32-ssd1306) to write pixels, shapes and characters to the display.

#### Configuration

```warning
Do NOT change pin definitions if you are using the standard PCBA or do not know what you are doing.
```

The `turtlebot4_base_node` pin definitions can be set with ROS parameters. The default configuration is:

```yaml
turtlebot4_base_node:
  ros__parameters:
    # GPIO definition for HMI. Do NOT change if you are using the standard PCBA.
    gpio:
      user_button_1: 13
      user_button_2: 19
      user_button_3: 16
      user_button_4: 26

      led_green_power: 17
      led_green_motors: 18
      led_green_comms: 27
      led_green_wifi: 24
      led_green_battery: 22
      led_red_battery: 23
      led_green_user_1: 25
      led_green_user_2: 6
      led_red_user_2: 12

      display_reset: 2
```

```note
The value for each GPIO device is the GPIO number, NOT the pin number.
```

#### Robot Upstart

The robot uses the [robot_upstart](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/tree/foxy-devel) package to install the bringup launch files as a background process that launches when the robot starts. The launch files are located under the `turtlebot4_bringup` package.

To check if the TurtleBot 4 service is running, use this command on the Raspberry Pi:

```bash
systemctl | grep turtlebot4
```

If the service is active, the CLI will echo `turtlebot4.service  loaded active running   "bringup turtlebot4"`.

To stop the service, call:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop turtlebot4.service
```

This will kill all of the nodes launched by the launch file. 

```note
The service will automatically start again on reboot. To fully disable the service, uninstall the job.
```

To start the service again, call:

```bash
sudo systemctl start turtlebot4.service
```

The launch files are installed on the TurtleBot 4 with this command:

```bash
ros2 run robot_upstart install turtlebot4_bringup/launch/standard.launch.py --job turtlebot4
```

and on the TurtleBot 4 Lite with this command:

```bash
ros2 run robot_upstart install turtlebot4_bringup/launch/lite.launch.py --job turtlebot4
```

To uninstall, use this command:

```bash
ros2 run robot_upstart uninstall turtlebot4
```

Once uninstalled, the launch file will no longer be launched on boot.

### Tests

The `turtlebot4_tests` packages contains the source code for the TurtleBot 4 system test scripts. These scripts test basic functionality of the robot and are useful for troubleshooting issues.

#### ROS Tests

The ROS tests use ROS topics and actions to test various system functionality. Test results are saved to `~/turtlebot4_test_results/Y_m_d-H_M_S` where `Y_m_d-H_M_S` is the date and time of the test. A rosbag is also recorded for the duration of the test and saved to the same location.

Currently supported tests:

- **Light Ring**: Test the Create® 3 light ring
- **Create® 3 Button**: Test the Create® 3 buttons
- **User LED**: Test the HMI LEDs (TurtleBot 4 model only)
- **User Button**: Test the HMI buttons (TurtleBot 4 model only)
- **Display**: Test the HMI display (TurtleBot 4 model only)
- **Dock**: Test the robots ability to undock and dock.

Running the tests:

```bash
ros2 run turtlebot4_tests ros_tests
```

This will launch a CLI menu where the different tests can be run.

Enter the index of the test and hit enter to start the test. Some tests will run automatically while others require user input.
